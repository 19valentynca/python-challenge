# python-challenge
In this challenge, I was tasked with dissecting 2 different datasets  
  
The first was to use a profits/losses dataset  
We calculated the differences in profits from month to month then found the average of differences  
Then, we found the max and min profits gains/losses  
The second was to use an election dataset in a small town  
I calculated the total votes for each candidate and then discovered the winner  
And then for both, I created text files from the output as well
